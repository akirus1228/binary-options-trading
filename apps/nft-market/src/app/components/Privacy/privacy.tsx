          If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom

        <h3>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:</h3>

          using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of
          personal information between our group companies and between us and our
          third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all
          personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in
          accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Standard
          Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar

          We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for

          required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
          requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us to keep your personal
          information for longer than 2 years.
        </h3>

        <h3>
          When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
          information, we will either delete or anonymize such information or, if this is
          not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
          backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
          isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

        <h2>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
        <h3>
          In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
          organizational and technical security measures.
        </h3>

        <h3>
          We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures
          designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
          However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
          electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can
          be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
          cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat
          our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
          Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, the
          transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own
          risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.

        <h3>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications

          your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
          monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for
          recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
          currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
          automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
          for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform
          you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
